# Overview

REPS is an app designed to aid personal trainers in their search for new clientele. As a new trainer or a trainer without numerous personal connections in the surrounding community, it can be difficult to market yourself to potential clients in your area. REPS allows you to create and customize an account as a trainer and get your name out to clients around you as well as manage those clients and their schedules after you connect with them.

#Features

 - View and search for trainers in your area as a potential client without logging in
 - Filter those search results through a keyword search as well as location and a distance radius
 - Log in or Register for an account as either a new trainer or client
 - As a logged-in client, view and interract with trainer profiles by requesting information or schedule training as well as create a new review of the trainer
 - As a logged-in trainer, customize your profile and add a headline post to appear at the top of your profile as an eye-catcher to draw in clients
 - As a logged-in trainer, manage your incoming request, client list, and session schedule through your trainer portal
 
 # Using the App
 
 When you first open the app you are taken to the home search screen where you can allow the browser to automatically filter by your current location or be prompted to enter a location in the search filters. From this screen, you can search and browse available verified trainers in your area and view their profiles and any review other users have left. 
 
 If you choose, you can log in or register for a new account where you will be prompted to choose either a trainer or client profile type. After registering you can customize your profile information. As a trainer, this information will be more in-depth allowing you to personalize what a user can see about you, as well as give you the option to create an initial headline post to go at the top of your profile.
 
 Once you are logged in as a trainer, you will be able to navigate your trainer portal, and as a client, you will be able to view any sessions that you may have scheduled with a trainer.
